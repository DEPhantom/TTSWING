# TTSWING: a Dataset for Table Tennis Swing and Racket Kinematics Analysis

Che-Yu Chou, Zheng-Hao Chen, Yung-Hoh Sheu, Hung-Hsuan Chen, Min-Te Sun, Sheng K. Wu

The repository contains the TTSWING dataset, a novel dataset for table tennis swing analysis. It also includes the code for the experiments on the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises comprehensive swing information obtained through 9-axis sensors integrated into custom-made racket grips, accompanied by anonymized demographic data of the players. The dataset contains 90,000+ collected stroke data from 93 Taiwanese players in Group A (the elite group). The participants included 53 males and 40 females; their ages ranged between 13 and 28 years old; their years of experience ranged between 1 to 19 years. They were asked to perform at least one of three different swing modes: swinging in the air, full power stroke, and stable hitting, denoted as mode 0 to mode 2, respectively. The participants swing the racket 50 times continuously in each mode to generate a complete waveform set, which is further transformed into tabular data. You can download the dataset [here](https://github.com/DEPhantom/TTSWING/blob/main/dataset/TTSWING.csv)

> **Note**
> In order to safeguard players' privacy, we categorized player age, height, weight, and play years into three tiers ("high," "medium," and "low") based on the current data distribution. The dataset will be continually updated in the presence of additional data or when the features can be released publicly.

  The unit of the accelerations (e.g., ax_mean, ay_mean, az_mean) is LSB/G (least significant bit per unit of G-force). By multiplying this value by 2/32768, the original G value can be obtained. The unit of angular velocities (e.g., gx_mean, gy_mean, gz_mean) is LSB/deg/s (least significant bit per unit of angular velocity). By multiplying this value by 250/32768, the original DPS (degree per second) can be obtained.

## Usage
To execute the code and run experiments, follow these.
Install
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/DEPhantom/TTSWING.git
```
Then `cd` into the root and run the command:
```Python
python classification_<X>.py
```
where `<X>` could be `gender`, `age`, `mode`, `holding`, or `exp_years`.

Each script generates an Excel file to summarize the results.

To compute statistical summaries of numerical and categorical features, run:
```Python
python show_stat.py
```

It outputs `categorical_stat_summary.csv` and `numerical_stat_summary.csv` in the same folder.

## Requirements
We tested the codes on `Python 3.10.4` (installed by `Conda`) on Mac. Package versions are available in `requirements.txt`, which is generated via `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. To install these packages, runs

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
